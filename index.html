                    <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
                    <p>From the moment I built my first "Hello World" application, I was hooked on the thought of becoming a developer. I fell into a lot of familiar routines in my work life. Software Development was a refreshing challenge that broke me out of those ruts. After studying on my own for about a year, I decided it was time to make a leap. That is when I started an accelerated program at Eleven Fifty Academy. That program was a 3 month bootcamp, which taught me .NET, C#, HTML, CSS, Angular, and more. I am currently working full time for Eleven Fifty as a Learning Data Specialist. A fancy title that means that I collect and manage student data, run analytics, and look for trends. When I am not at my day job, I am often working on personal projects and doing freelance work. When I am not at the computer, I am with my wife and two daughters or else either watching or playing hockey. We spend a lot of time in state parks both in Indiana and in the St. Louis area, where I grew up. The image at the top is a common destination for the family, Castlewood! As far as career goals, I am excited to dive further into IT, as well as the chance to learn and grow as an individual and a developer. It is a lot of fun and is a challenge that I have been craving for a long time in my professional life.</p>

                            <p>This was one of my first projects in HTML and CSS. The goal of the project is a static HTML page built to gain more familiarity with HTML5 and CSS3. I created anchors that lead to various parts of the page, a basic nav bar, filled the page with content, and styled the layout. I have ideas to build upon this and possibly use it in the future.</p>

                            <p>This application is a little more complicated. It is an application built with ASP.NET using the MVC architectural pattern. The live version has been temporarily taken down, however, the logic still works. This project was a lot of fun to build and test. I have a few ideas to add on in the future and will continue to improve this in my spare time.</p>

                            <p>This was a group project that I helped to develop. We created an application that uses a connection to Spotify's API to analyze songs and playlists for a logged in user. For the front end, we used Angular to format our application. For the backend, we used a WebAPI project. The backend currently needs to be run locally, however, the front end is viewable by clicking the image above. This was a lot of fun and everyone in the group grew in our skills.</p>

                            <p>This is a freelance project I have been developing with a startup team. Unfortunately, I am not able to go into detail about the application. I have consulted and developed for this since October of 2019. It is being built in .NET Core. I have learned a lot about the ins and outs of the framework from this work. The opportunity has also provided a more intricate look at working with outside API's. If you have questions, or want to contact the project owner, feel free to reach out!</p>
