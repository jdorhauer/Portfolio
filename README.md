## About

This project is where I house the code for my portfolio. Navigate [here](https://dorhauertech.dev) to view the live version. While front end development is not my spectialty, I am constantly trying to evaluate and tweak this to make it better. If you have any suggestions, feel free to submit them in a form in the bottom of the page!


## Changes to come

I am looking to offer an option to host live versions of the projects contained in this portfolio. The main thing I am researching is a cheaper option for back end hosting than what I have found so far.
