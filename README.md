## About

This project is where I house the code for my portfolio. Navigate [here](https://dorhauertech.dev) to view the live version. While front end development is not my spectialty, I am constantly trying to evaluate and tweak this to make it better. If you have any suggestions, feel free to submit them in a form in the bottom of the page!


## Changes to come

I am looking into buying a domain to host this site. Ideally, it would give me the opportunity to not only host my portfolio, but offer an option to host live versions of my projects.
